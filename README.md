# CascadeEngine
A WIP fully raytraced voxel game engine, with a focus on fast, dynamic worlds. Written from scratch in Vulkan.

NOTE: The label of 'engine' is mostly aspirational as of now. It is not set up to be easily extensible, or really function like an engine should. Once the main features are there, i'd like to start moving in that direction.

## Showcase
Every voxel in the game world is updated every frame. Since this can involve updating 100s of billions of voxels per second, it is done in parallel using a compute shader.

Here is some of the behaviour in action, dropped sand settles into piles:

Water is still a work in progress. Right now it's spread is too slow, causing water levels to equalize slower than feels natural.

## Documentation

## Implementation
### Graphics Library and Pipeline
### Physics
### Raytracing


### Denoising
Right now, I use a number of denoising strategies:
- Blue noise
- Temporal accumulation with reprojection
- Edge-avoiding atrous wavelet filter

[#6](https://github.com/Jack-Rickwood/CascadeEngine/issues/6) contains some ideas for how i'd like to improve this process in the future.

### GUI
As of now, the config GUI is implemented very crudely using SFML / the tGUI library. What this means is that SFML creates a separate OpenGL context that runs in parallel alongside the main Vulkan application. This is not ideal, but I couldn't think of an alternative that wouldn't have required rewriting my rendering code to use a traditional Vulkan graphics pipeline. The current GUI is mostly a bandaid solution to allow me to quickly tweak settings, and will ideally be replaced in the future.
